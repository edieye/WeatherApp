# WeatherApp
A simple weather application that provides you weather details based off location. I wanted to practice using simple Javascript libraries
to deliver something quick and simple to the user and hence I used [jquery](https://jquery.com/). I will probably try to expand on 
this idea in the future but leaving it as such for now.
